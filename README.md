# SCCM-Security-Group-Export-Tool
An internal tool that organises security groups, exporting them into a properly formatted list of groups that can be pasted into your new or existing WQL query scripts.

### Note
This can also be expanded with the use of system center cmdlets to automate the process entirely. Or, integrated with existing SCCM scripts in your repository.
