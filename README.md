# SCCM-Security-Group-Export-Tool
An internal tool that organises security groups and exports them for a quick and easy import into system center.

### Note
This can also be expanded with the use of system center cmdlets to automate the process entirely. Or, integrated with existing SCCM scripts in your repository.
